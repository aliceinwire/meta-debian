tests
====================

meta-debian is a set of recipes (metadata) for the poky build system, 
which allows cross-building GNU/Linux images using Debian source packages.
By enabling meta-debian, you can cross-build a small GNU/Linux image 
with Debian sources for multiple architectures.

The main purpose of meta-debian is to provide reference Linux distribution 
for embedded systems satisfying the following needs.
* Long-term support
* Stability
* Wide embedded CPU support
* Customizability

Supported Versions
==================

This branch provides recipes to cross-build Debian source packages
of the following Debian version. These recipes are compatible
with the following Yocto Project version.

* Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
* Yocto Project 2.7 (warrior)

Supported Build Environment
===========================

This branch is tested on the following build environment.

* Distribution: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
* Architecture: amd64

Quick Start
===========

This section introduces how to generate the minimal system with meta-debian
and how to run it on the QEMU environment.

Setup build environment
-----------------------

In case of using the [supported build environment](#supported-build-environment),
run the following commands.

    $ git clone -b warrior git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
    $ git clone -b warrior https://github.com/meta-debian/meta-debian.git poky/meta-debian
    $ sudo ./poky/meta-debian/scripts/install-deps.sh

Otherwise, use the docker container.

    $ git clone -b warrior https://github.com/meta-debian/meta-debian.git
    $ make -C meta-debian/docker

Build target images
-------------------

Setup the build directory.

    $ export TEMPLATECONF=meta-debian/conf
    $ source ./poky/oe-init-build-env

Set `MACHINE` variable in `conf/local.conf` to one of the following machines.

* qemux86 (default)
* qemux86-64
* qemuarm
* qemuarm64
* qemuppc
* qemumips

Example:

    MACHINE = "qemuarm"

Now ready for building.
Build Linux kernel and the minimal rootfs by the following command.
It takes a while to complete (more than 30 minutes).

    $ bitbake core-image-minimal

Run images on QEMU
------------------

Run the images built in the above step on QEMU.
Please replace `${MACHINE}` by the target machine you selected in the above step.

    $ runqemu ${MACHINE} nographic

After boot, you can login as `root` without password.
